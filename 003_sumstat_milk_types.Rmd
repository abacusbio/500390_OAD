```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F, warning = F, message = F,
                      root.dir = "e:/500390_OAD/output/sumstat_production/" )
```

Preliminary analysis of **ProductionExtract.csv**  

The objective is to get cleaned useful herds and cows for subsequent analysis.
Also to generate milk type (OAD, TAD, Transition) and find the transition year.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
